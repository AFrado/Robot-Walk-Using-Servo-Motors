# Robot Walk Using Servo Motors
 Arduino IDE code to control 6 servo motors to simulate walking movements for a robot. This code assumes you have the servos connected to pins 2 to 7 on the Arduino and that the servos are set up to move in a way that simulates walking. 
The file contain an Arduino IDE code.

The electrical components that used are:
- 6 servo motors.
- Arduino UNO.
- Voltage Regulator 5V.
- 9V Battery.

Circuit connection are shown below.

Robot movement explaination:

Right Leg Forward: The right hip moves forward to 45 degrees, then the right knee bends to 90 degrees, followed by the right ankle moving forward to 45 degrees.

Left Leg Backward: The left hip moves backward to 135 degrees, then the left knee straightens to 0 degrees, followed by the left ankle moving backward to 135 degrees.
