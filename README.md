# Robot Walk Using Servo Motors Arduino IDE code to control 6 servo motors.

The code are in Arduino IDE app. it uses Servo library to program 6 servo motors. 
the code started by definding the 6 digital output pins. then, control each servo motor indiviually. each 3 motors are reprsenting one leg.

**Robot movement explaination:**

Right Leg Forward: The right hip moves forward to 45 degrees, then the right knee bends to 90 degrees, followed by the right ankle moving forward to 45 degrees.

Left Leg Backward: The left hip moves backward to 135 degrees, then the left knee straightens to 0 degrees, followed by the left ankle moving backward to 135 degrees.
