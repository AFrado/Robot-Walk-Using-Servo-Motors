# Robot Walk Using Servo Motors
 Arduino IDE code to control 6 servo motors to simulate walking movements for a robot. This code assumes you have the servos connected to pins 2 to 7 on the Arduino and that the servos are set up to move in a way that simulates walking. 
The file contain an Arduino IDE code.

The electrical components that used are:
- 6 servo motors.
- Arduino UNO.
- Voltage Regulator 5V.
- 9V Battery.

Circuit connection are shown below.
