# Robot Walk Using Servo Motors
 Arduino IDE code to control 6 servo motors to simulate walking movements for a robot. This code assumes you have the servos connected to pins 2 to 7 on the Arduino and that the servos are set up to move in a way that simulates walking.  ![Image](https://github.com/users/AFrado/projects/1/assets/174622127/72b12530-ce73-4da6-bc00-c839627ccb58)
